Amazon Route 53
===============
1. setting up a domain in route53
   * DNS ROUTE53 DNS name to route to EC2 elastic Load Balancer
   - management console -> EC2 -> scroll down to Load balancer
   - create load balancer -> enter details
     - select at least 2 subnets in different AZs
	 - assign security groups
	 - configure health check (port 80, default page) configure failure count
	 - add EC2 instances
	 - create
   - Route53  (need a registered domain name)
     - create(purchase) or select existing
	 - if not purchased from amazon, define NS (name servers).
	 - if purchased, select (copy and paste) the amazon ones
	
2. configuring your Failwhale
   * configuring failover when the health check fails to a secondary address	
   - create health check
     - dashboard -> health checks
	   - create, name , monitor endpoint, protocol http
	   - create 2 record sets, one for primary, one for failover 
	     - hosted zones -> select -> create record set
		   - IP address, routing policy = failover, type = primary, associate with health check
		   - its type = A 
		 - create record set (2nd)
           - same subdomain name, 	Alias radio button, target = secondary IP, failover, type = secondary
           - not associated with health check		

3. Latency based routing
   * distributes traffic based on latency (tries to route for lowest latency ie closest)	   
   - hosted zones -> select
     - create record set, select endpoint ip, alias = No, type = A, routing policy = Latency (requires region) health check not required
	 - create record set, type = A, alias = No, use different IP address, use a different region
   - when someone accesses this website, now they will be routed to whichever IP is closest (lowest latency) to them.	 
   
4. Weighted round robin routing
   * 
   - hosted zones -> select domain 
     - create record set. select subdomain, type = A, select endpoint, routing policy = weighted, weight = eg 100
	 - create record set. same subdomain, type = A, select different endpoint, routing policy = weighted = eg 0
	 - the 100/0 split ensures only routed to first not second. can slowly change ration to route traffic to second 
	 
5. Amazon WorkMail
   * low cost email system (not available everywhere)
   - create organisation
     - creates email domain with encrypted mailboxes
   - add domain
     - allows different email addresses across the domains
	 - set up Domain Keys Identified Mail - DKIM - signing
	 - switch the MX records and Autodiscover DNS records when mailbox migration is complete
	   - easiest to do in small groups eg 25
     - verified domain ownership -> create or select TXT record (_amazonses.<domain>
	 - verify TXT
	 - create MX record and CNAME records (canonical names eg  cname: ftp.example.com and www.example.com both point to example.com
	                                       A record points example.com to the IP address)
   - create users, groups and resources
     - workmail -> select organisation -> create users
	 - create users
	 
	 
Amazon IoT
==========
1. Device registry and Shadows	 
   * choose a thing name that is consistent with the client id used by MQTT communications
   - AWS IoT -> connect to AWS IoT 
   - create resource  (things, rules, thing types, certificates, policies
   - thing shadow maintains the current state of the device
     - JSON - desired state, last reported state.
	   - compute a delta to send to device to achieve the desired state

2. Things and certificates
   - create a thing	   (name, attributes
   - view a thing  (view/update shadow)
   - create certificate -> generate public and private keys
     - must copy the VeriSigns roots CA certificate onto your device (proof of identity)
	   - documentation AWS IoT::Security and Identity::Authentication in AWS IoT
	   - click the link 'copy the {VeriSign root CA certificate} onto your device'
	   - optional ** change the name to root-CA.crt
   - associate the certificate with your thing
     - select certificate
	 - attach to thing (select thing)
   - create a policy to give that thing permission to do stuff
     - create (name, action {iot.*} allow resource {*}
	 - add statement
	 - create
   - attach to certificate

3. Topics and Messages
   * configure an MQTT client to test out this communication flow
   - MQTT.fx connection properties
     - broker address: AWS IoT  '?' over to the right -> scroll to bottom -> copy "endpoint"
     - create your profile (name, broker address from above, port {default:8883}
	   - client id displayed is unique identifier for your client (must be unique to that client)
	   - enable SSL/TLS, enter certificate details and public key file, tick PEM format
	   - MQTT can query the thing and display the response
	   - suscribe the MQTT client in AWS IoT to the topic the thing returns
	   - MQTT service publish to client, MQTT client will show the message received by the thing

4. AWS IoT Rules Engine
   * states what happens when message is received.
     eg SELECT * FROM 'test/chap1'  -> SNS Action, Lambda Action
	 - SNS target needs to be defined first


Amazon messaging Services
=========================
1. SNS - Simple Notification Service
   * publishers and subscribers
   * topics   
   - create new topic (name, description)
   - create subscription to topic (topic, protocol, endpoint( where to send notifications)
   - confirm subscription
   - edit topic policy publish users, subscribe users
   - publish a message
   - subscriptions can be deleted, topics can be deleted
   
2. SQS - Simple Queue Service
   * messages wait in queues until they have been processed. (max 256k)
   * supports multiple readers and writers
   * when consumer pools for message, the message is hidden from the consumers, and a timer starts
     - if the message is processed and deleted before the timer finishes, all is good
	 - if the timeout elapses, the message is restored to visibility, and can be consumed.
   - create new queue => SQS -> create new queue
   - view queue - details, permissions ,actions {send message, purge queue, delete queue, configure}
   
3. SWS - Simple Workflow Service
   * node.js example
   

Deployment on Amazon
====================
* docker  www.docker.com
  - replaces the hypervisor, does away with the need for guest OS
  - container has much smaller footprint, starts much faster
  - built on node.js
  - Dockerfile defines the wrapper around the node.js app
      example   FROM node:1.23
	            WORKDIR /app
				ADD . /app
				RUN npm install
				EXPOSE 3000
				CMD node index.js
   - docker commands (examples only)
     >docker image   // lists the generated images
	 >docker ps      // which containers are currently running
	 >docker ps -a   // list contains available to run
	 >docker start <container id>
	 
* docker hub - repository in cloud hosted by Docker where you can push and pull images

* kitematic - useful for interacting with docker instances

* docker installation and setup
  - install from www.docker.com
    - select platform -> download
	- execute to install
	** Docker uses VirtualBox under the hood and is not compatible with Hyper-V

* docker commands:
  >docker build -t {name}:{tag} .  // runs the docker file, then creates an image (snapshot)
  >docker run -it {image_id} {command to run}  // i- = interactive -t = use terminal cmd eg /bin/bash
  >docker help
  >docker stop
  +exit    // when in the bash shell on the instance
  >docker rm {continer_id}   // removes the container (as shown in docker ps or ps -a
  >docker rmi {image_id}    // from docker image
  
  
* Creating a CloudFormation stack
  - create cloudformation stack (enter a admin passwork, enter keypair, modify the StreamName
  - options tags, notifications (with confirmation)
  
* running the Cloudformation stack  
  - click on AMS server key to check it is running
  - connect the instance to the streaming encoder such as flash, adobe media server
  
* cloud formation  => outputs, resources, events, templates (JSOPN format), parameters, tags, stack policy, change sets
  - resources can be EC2 or other Amazon
  - cloud formation templates are available from Amazon under documentation
  
* Elastic beanstalk
  - create environment (Web Server Environment | Worker Environment (queue processing)}
    - options for language
	- option for load balance
	- option to use sample or upload 
	- can create RDS database and associate with environment (if you kill the environment, you will kill this associated DB, 
	   Solution: do it later)
  - create new application
  
* Amazon Shared Security Responsibility Model
  * security best practices available from amazonwebservices.com
    - AWS is responsible fore the infrastructure security, you are responsible for the application layer
