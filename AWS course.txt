Amazon Route 53
1. setting up a domain in route53
   * DNS ROUTE53 DNS name to route to EC2 elastic Load Balancer
   - management console -> EC2 -> scroll down to Load balancer
   - create load balancer -> enter details
     - select at least 2 subnets in different AZs
	 - assign security groups
	 - configure health check (port 80, default page) configure failure count
	 - add EC2 instances
	 - create
   - Route53  (need a registered domain name)
     - create(purchase) or select existing
	 - if not purchased from amazon, define NS (name servers).
	 - if purchased, select (copy and paste) the amazon ones
	
2. configuring your Failwhale
   * configuring failover when the health check fails to a secondary address	
   - create health check
     - dashboard -> health checks
	   - create, name , monitor endpoint, protocol http
	   - create 2 record sets, one for primary, one for failover 
	     - hosted zones -> select -> create record set
		   - IP address, routing policy = failover, type = primary, associate with health check
		   - its type = A 
		 - create record set (2nd)
           - same subdomain name, 	Alias radio button, target = secondary IP, failover, type = secondary
           - not associated with health check		

3. Latency based routing
   * distributes traffic based on latency (tries to route for lowest latency ie closest)	   
   - hosted zones -> select
     - create record set, select endpoint ip, alias = No, type = A, routing policy = Latency (requires region) health check not required
	 - create record set, type = A, alias = No, use different IP address, use a different region
   - when someone accesses this website, now they will be routed to whichever IP is closest (lowest latency) to them.	 
   
4. Weighted round robin routing
   * 
   - hosted zones -> select domain 
     - create record set. select subdomain, type = A, select endpoint, routing policy = weighted, weight = eg 100
	 - create record set. same subdomain, type = A, select different endpoint, routing policy = weighted = eg 0
	 - the 100/0 split ensures only routed to first not second. can slowly change ration to route traffic to second 
	 
5. Amazon WorkMail
   * low cost email system (not available everywhere)
   - create organisation
     - creates email domain with encrypted mailboxes
   - add domain
     - allows different email addresses across the domains
	 - set up Domain Keys Identified Mail - DKIM - signing
	 - switch the MX records and Autodiscover DNS records when mailbox migration is complete
	   - easiest to do in small groups eg 25
     - verified domain ownership -> create or select TXT record (_amazonses.<domain>
	 - verify TXT
	 - create MX record and CNAME records (canonical names eg  cname: ftp.example.com and www.example.com both point to example.com
	                                       A record points example.com to the IP address)
   - create users, groups and resources
     - workmail -> select organisation -> create users
	 - create users
